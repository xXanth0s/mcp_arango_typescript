# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in the implementation phase with a functional ArangoDB-backed API. The system provides CRUD operations for users, items, and orders with the appropriate relationships between them. We have transitioned from Node.js/ts-node-dev to Bun for improved performance and developer experience.

## Open Issues
1. **Type Errors**: Several TypeScript errors in route handlers and transaction code need to be fixed
2. **ArangoDB Transaction API**: Error with transaction implementation in the OrderRepository
3. **Collection Naming**: Docker service vs. ArangoDB collection naming inconsistency may cause issues

## Next Steps
1. Fix TypeScript errors in router files by explicitly typing the router
2. Resolve transaction implementation issues in OrderRepository
3. Standardize the ArangoDB connection service
4. Implement proper error handling for ArangoDB connections
5. Add authentication and authorization for API endpoints
6. Add validation middleware for request bodies
7. Add unit and integration tests
8. Verify that all scripts work correctly with Bun

## Recent Changes
1. Set up TypeScript project with ESLint
2. Added ArangoDB connection service
3. Created database initialization script
4. Implemented repository pattern for data access
5. Created Express API routes for all entities
6. Set up Docker Compose for ArangoDB
7. Migrated from Node.js/ts-node-dev to Bun runtime for all scripts

## Current Decisions
1. Using ES Modules instead of CommonJS
2. Implementing repository pattern for data access
3. Storing edges with metadata (amount, date) between entities
4. Using AQL template literals for queries
5. Explicit typing of all functions and parameters
6. Using Bun for all runtime and build tasks

## Working Notes
- ArangoDB should be running before API starts (dependency)
- Database initialization should be run after first deployment
- All repositories follow similar patterns for consistency
- Error responses are standardized across the API
- Sensitive data like passwords should not be returned to clients
- Bun's faster performance should improve development workflow
