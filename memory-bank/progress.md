## Known Issues
1. TypeScript errors in route handlers due to express.Router typing
2. ArangoDB transaction API signature mismatch in OrderRepository
3. Collection naming in Docker vs. code may cause confusion
4. Need proper error handling for database connection failures
5. Security concerns with plain text passwords
6. May require Bun-specific adjustments for some features

## Next Milestones
1. Fix all TypeScript errors
2. Add database connection error handling
3. Implement request validation
4. Add authentication with JWT
5. Implement automated tests
6. Optimize build process with Bun
