# Product Context

## Purpose
This project provides a TypeScript-based API for a simple e-commerce application backed by ArangoDB. It demonstrates how to implement a graph database for managing relationships between users, items, and orders efficiently.

## Problem Solved
Traditional SQL databases require complex joins to represent relationships between entities. This project showcases how graph databases (specifically ArangoDB) can simplify these relationships using edges, making it easier to:
1. Track which users placed which orders
2. Store order details including items and quantities
3. Navigate relationships in both directions efficiently
4. Query complex relationships without complex joins

## Target Users
1. **Developers**: Learning ArangoDB and graph databases
2. **API Consumers**: Frontend applications or services that need e-commerce functionality
3. **Data Analysts**: Who need to query relationships between users, orders, and items

## Core Use Cases
1. **User Management**:
   - Create, read, update and delete users
   - Retrieve users with their order history

2. **Item Management**:
   - Add, update, and remove product items
   - Search items by name and check low stock items
   - Track item popularity based on orders

3. **Order Processing**:
   - Create orders with multiple items
   - Manage order status through its lifecycle
   - Retrieve order details with items and quantities
   - View order history for specific users

4. **Inventory Management**:
   - Automatically update stock levels when orders are placed
   - Identify items that are low in stock

## User Experience Goals
- Clean REST API structure
- Consistent error messaging
- Well-defined data models
- Efficient query responses
- Graph-based relationship navigation
- Intuitive API endpoints
